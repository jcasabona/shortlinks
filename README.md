# Short URL Generator 
___________________________________

A simple short URL generator I made for rwdwp.com. 

## Setup

**You'll need to create a database and import shortlinks.sql. Sorry- no installer right now :-/**

1. Install the database
2. Fill in config.php with all of the proper information. 
3. Upload the files! 

## Some Notes

1. I've also included the .htaccess file I used to get the pretty URLs working. Be sure to include that. 
2. There is no authentication method included. The quickest way would be to throw an .htpasswd into /admin/. I may integreate some Auth in the future
3. This is a little side project I did and decided to release so I'm not really supporting it, but if you find any issues let me know...or fork and fix em- I don't mind :-)
4. *This is released under the MIT License, so do with it what you will.*
